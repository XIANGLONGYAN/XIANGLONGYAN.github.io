Welcome to Xianglong Yan’s (闫相龙) personal website!

I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), majoring in Computer Science and Technology in the School of Computer Science.

I am advised by Prof. Yulun Zhang.

My research focuses on efficient large language model (LLM) deployment, with particular interests in model compression techniques such as post-training quantization (PTQ), low-bit quantization, and binarization/ternarization. I aim to build accurate yet resource-efficient LLM systems that are practical for real-world deployment. ⚡

I am always open to collaborations and academic discussions. Feel free to reach out via email at yanxianglong@sjtu.edu.cn.
